# About

The primary goal of the Phase 1 Airframe development is to focus on prooving out the concepts of the project.  The attributes of a test-bed aircraft is that it be simple yet mechanically robust (space for equipment), seats two for pilot and test engineer, aero-dynamically stable, easy to fly and experimental.

Candidate airframes;

- Vans RV-9A
- Sonex 
- Zenith CH 601

We will purchase an actively flying airframe, from the list above, in a known airworthy condition.
