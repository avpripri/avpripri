# Aviation Primary Principals

This project sets to make an order-of-magnatude improvement in small aircraft safety.  Secondary goals include damatically lowering the bar for learning and operating small aircraft.

## Yesterday and Today

Aviation has a varied safety history.  Through rigourous controls, learning and testing large aircraft have become very very safe.  Too few of these aspects have trickled down to small aircraft.  This is due to cost and complexity.  Yet it's these light aircraft where all pilots are made and still the safety of any light aircraft poor.

Here is the summary of the 27th 2017-2018 Nall Report;

_Other or unknown 10.4% - 101 Total_ - So, if we're honest there's not much anyone can do about these, at some level, aviation has risks, we should acknowledge we can't resolve all problems, but maybe some of these "unknown" accidents might not have happened if the airplane hadn't been in the wrong place at the wrong time. 

_Mechanical  15.7% - 152 Total_ - Many mechanical accidents are avoidable with purposely build and tested 100% redundancy at all levels.

_Pilot-related  73.8% - 714 Total_ - This is entirely unacceptable and avoidable.  If you take away nothing from the Nall report, every pilot should recognize theya re the weakest and most important link in aviation safety.  This project attempts to fix that.

The Nall report has been trending safer for decades... many in the industry site Electronic cockpits and ballistic parachutes, while I agree they are good, I do not think they are enough.  There's no excuse for fuel starvation or CFIT 100+ years after kitty hawk.

## First Principal

This project is founded on the principal that an order of magnitude improvement in overall light aircraft aviation safety is obviously achievable.  That's 97 accidents where we have 967 today.  But to do that it requires a "first principal" approach.  Strip down the aircraft, what it does how it functions and what the pilots role is in and out of the cockpit. 

## Imagine how...

[tbd] Tell some stories about how a couple typical missions could be done using this system.

# The approach

I see two avenues of approaching this problem.  

_First_, tare down the walls of traditional aviation and rebuild a new system with safety factored into every aspect (human and metalic).

_Secondly_, Use the data we already have to rebuild a system that directly addresses the causes of so many accidents.  Visual flight into clouds, fuel starvation, controlled flight into terrain, training related accidents... etc until we have addressed all concerns directly. 

## The pilot

FAR 91.3(a)
 The pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft.

Given this responsibility the aircraft systems must always provide the pilot with everything he needs to achieve this objective.

The pilot's roll is to express the intent of each mission.  The system is empowered to execute on that intent as much as possible with direct supervision of the pilot.  

## The aircraft

Every flight-critical system is mechanically and electrically redunent with automated/instantanous failure modes.  This includes, but is not limitted to;
- engine
- motor
- fuel
- flight system
- navigation
- display

## The brains; Flight Management System (FMS)

At the center is "the brains" or the flight management system.  This isn't artificial intelligence or a better autopilot.  It's really an expert system programmed with common sense rules about flying.  Factoring in all critical aspects like;

- Systems
- Weather
- Attitude
- Fuel
- Flight Rules (airspace, minimums, clearances)
- Navigation
- Communication

It is taking in all of the above factors (and more) to asses risk which gives or takes away control from the pilot to ensure safety.

# Concerns

_Machines don't make machines safer, look at the 737 Max_  Flawed redundancy which actually doubles the failure modes are fatal.  ie.. multi-engines that can't climb on one engine.  Any redundent system must be tested for partial and total failure modes.  No partial failure mode should cause additional failures or total loss of any one system.

_The more you take the pilot out of the loop, flying won't be fun_  If you have plenty of altitude and weather is great and you stay inside the envlope, the plane will let you do anything you want.  Loops, rolls, etc if aerobatics is in the envelope.  But as you get lower, slower in weather... you'll find progressively less and less control.

# Proof of concept vehicle

The project is going to convert a light homebuilt experimental aircraft for use as a test-bed for the overall concepts expressed in this page.  

## Phase 1

Aquire an airframe and develope the hardware. This includes 100% redent;
- Powerplant
- Fuel system
- Electrical system
- Flight control system

## Phase 2

Testing
- Built-in
- Ground
- Air

## Phase 3 

Expand and learn - Get this system out for others to build into their homebuilt projects and begin flying more safely.  Explore how this system can be used as a teaching platform for safer flying in general.
