# Aviation Primary Principals

_Disrupting General Aviation accessibility by making it safer, easier and more affordable_

This project sets to make an order-of-magnitude improvement in small aircraft safety.  Secondary goals include dramatically lowering the bar for learning and operating small aircraft.

## Yesterday and Today

Aviation has a varied safety history.  Through rigorous controls, learning and testing large aircraft have become very very safe.  Too few of these aspects have trickled down to small aircraft.  This is due to cost and complexity.  Yet it's these light aircraft where all pilots are made and still the safety of any light aircraft poor.

Here is the summary of the 27th 2017-2018 Nall Report;

_Other or unknown 10.4% - 101 Total_ - So, if we're honest there's not much anyone can do about these, at some level, aviation has risks, we should acknowledge we can't resolve all problems, but maybe some of these "unknown" accidents might not have happened if the airplane hadn't been in the wrong place at the wrong time. 

_Mechanical  15.7% - 152 Total_ - Many mechanical accidents are avoidable with purposely build and tested 100% redundancy at all levels.

_Pilot-related  73.8% - 714 Total_ - This is entirely unacceptable and avoidable.  If you take away nothing from the Nall report, every pilot should recognize they're the weakest and most important link in aviation safety.  This project attempts to fix that.

The Nall report has been trending safer for decades... many in the industry site Electronic cockpits and ballistic parachutes, while I agree they are good, I do not think they are enough.  There's no excuse for fuel starvation or CFIT 100+ years after kitty hawk.

## First Principal

In order push through incremental and become disruptive, we have to disassemble the core aviation "Whys".  Why are people flying, why are people learning to fly.

From these tenants, we rebuild, ground-up, from new assumptions and new decisions without old paradigms and solutions.  

## Priorities

These priorities attempt to directly address that general aviation is not at all generally accessible; 

_Safety_ - This project is founded on the principal that an order of magnitude improvement in overall light aircraft aviation safety is obviously achievable.  That's 97 accidents where we have 967 today.  But to do that it requires a "first principal" approach.  Strip down the aircraft, what it does how it functions and what the pilots role is in and out of the cockpit. 

_Easy_ - Any ten year old can fly a plane on a nice day, it's not at all hard... It's very hard to fly a plane safely in all conditions at all times.  This project proposes an "active-active" stability enhancement and envelope-protection flight control system.  This system relaxes and virtually disappears in "safe" flight regimes and seamlessly becomes more aggressive in high risk environments.   The flight system will also feature "designed-in" skills building flight exercises to "flattening" the learning curve and enhance "hands-on" in-flight learning and enabling pilots to gain skills most effectively at their own pace in a totally objective, safe environment.

_Affordable_ - Pilots that can't afford to fly often, aren't flying at their potential.  Many of the other goals of this project have secondary impacts to bottom line... IE an easier-to-fly and safer plane needs cheaper insurance.  The direct operating cost of electric aircraft is in single dollars per hour vs. hundred(s) for gasoline.  If it was $10/hr or $100 a day to rent an aircraft, I think we'd see entirely different use cases, even Uber-like commuter scenarios and metropolitan transport/commuter cases.

## Imagine how...

You come out to the airfield to see your beautiful airplane again.  You give it one cursory walk around only looking for any gross damage then hop in.  That's your entire pre-flight.  Push on both brakes for a moment and the displays comes alive as diagnostics begin.  It will run a complete check on all electrical, then oil-levels, tire pressure, control system, brakes and finally fuel systems checking.  It noticed you filled up after you shut down and reset the fuel to a couple gallons under full where you left it.

With diagnostics complete, using the on-board-weight-sensors, the system asks..

"Weight is 1237 pounds, 224 pounds under gross, balance is 23% aft of forward limit, we have 4hrs and 23 minutes of cruise fuel on board.  What is your mission today?"

You pull your headset on, press the "Push to Listen" (PTL) button and say

You say, "North east practice area"

The situation display shows where you are on the ramp, and paints a blue line to the active runway.  It highlights 122.8 frequency selected and prompts...

"If the area is clear, say 'N12345 Taxing for runway 24 via Alpha' on the tuned Unicom frequency"

You do as directed, the strobes turn on and few moments later the prop starts to spin at a whisper then a whir as the wheels ease forward and turn towards Alpha taxiway.  En-route you hear the generator start-up, the flight controls go to full stops and you notice the brakes actuate under a heavier propeller load.  The monitor confirms it's running the pre-flight checks on the taxi.  It all calms down as you turn down the long taxiway and the system prompts you...

"All systems are operating normally. There is no observed traffic on TCAS.  Winds are 5 knots at 220, 20 degrees off the left with a cross-wind component of 2 knots, density altitude is 812 feet, sky is clear.  If the runway is clear, announce 'N12345 North-east VFR departing runway 24 from Alpha'"

The approach is clear, you do as instructed and the display a big "Ready for take off" as the propeller whirs to life again and you slide into position on the runway.  As the plane comes to a stop, it says...

"Ready for take off, in case of emergency on runway, apply brakes and come to a stop.  If air born and room to land, land on runway, bellow 600 land in the field to the left.  Above 600 a turn around is possible, say take off when ready."

You press the PTL and announce "Take off!"

The motors roars to life as the airframe strains against the brakes holding it back.  You realize there's one last full power check and right then, the brakes release and your pulled forward down the runway.

"Airspeed 30...40..45... All green, rotate"

You speed up briskly down the runway and ease back as the airplane says rotate and the nose of the plane raises above the horizon... wheels off.

"Wheels off... All green... 50 feet, straight ahead"

The field to the left is obviously nice and wide open a good spot to land if one had to.  The monitor shows it painted in faint translucent green in the airport map and the words The tall trees and hill to the right are in red and "Warning - Terrain" is displayed nearby.

"All green... 200 feet, straight ahead"

"All green... 400 feet, straight ahead"

"All green... 600 feet, turn-back available."

The terrain warning clears

"All green 1000... Turning Right 040..."

And the plane gently rolls to the right and starts a gentle standard rate turn

"All green 2000.. "

The wings level at 040 a moment later the nose pitches down

"Level 2500"

You look around and enjoy the view as you head out to the practice area, you can feel the plane giving gengtle feedback.  You know you are in command, but it's really doing the leveling. If you try to turn it, it just resists and tries to head back on the blue line it's obediently following.

"Arriving at the north east practice area, what maneuvers do you want to practice?"

"Stalls"

"OK, we'll need to clear the area first, start by doing two 90 degree turns in either direction"

You pull the stick left and the plane just follows along, there might be a little resistance, but it's letting you do your maneuvers.  As you level out it says...

"Ok, begin your stall by powering back, then apply progressive aft stick to stay level"

You pull the throttle back and the propellers whirr gets a little lighter, you pull the elevator aft further.

.. as the speed starts to bleed off, "Recovery is immediate full power and pitch the nose over gently".  

The nose pops and the tail buffets as you hit the aft limit of the elevator travel.

"Recover"

But you're not very comfortable with stalls yet and you just freeze.  The airplane waits a moment and just before the nose cuts over...

"Release controls!" is commanded abruptly in a harsh demanding voice.

The airplane applies rudder to stop the spin that's started and coordinates power and enough elevator to recover as normal flight is restored.  Started you decide it's time to head back home...

"What is the next maneuver you'd like to perform"

You say... "I'm done, let's head home"

"Ok... Unicome is already tuned in, say 'N12345 15 miles to the north east with AWOS, proceeding inbound for full stop runway 24'" 

You comply but right then... you fade off and something dims it's not good.

The airplane realises you're not responsive and your pulse is erratic.  It asks you twice to state your landing attempt, but you're out cold.

The airplane states over the radio "N12345, declaring emergency with an incapacitated pilot please have medical personnel ready and clear runway 24 for emergency landing" 

The airplane lands itself slows down and announces again...

"N12345, emergency declared taxing from runway 24 via Alpha autonomously please clear all runways and taxiways and have emergency personnel available"

The plane taxies to the tie down it started from, shuts down and waits as the ambulance pulls into the spot.  The doors open and they rescue you from what could have been fatal in several ways.

## The pilot

FAR 91.3(a)
 The pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft.

Given this responsibility the aircraft systems must always provide the pilot with everything he needs to achieve this objective.

The pilot's roll is to express the intent of each mission.  The system is empowered to execute on that intent as much as possible with direct supervision of the pilot.  

## The aircraft

Every flight-critical system is mechanically and electrically redundant with automated/instantaneous failure modes.  This includes, but is not limited to;
- engine
- motor
- fuel
- flight system
- navigation
- display

## The brains; Flight Management System (FMS)

At the center is "the brains" or the flight management system.  This isn't artificial intelligence or a better autopilot.  It's really an expert system programmed with common sense rules about flying.  Factoring in all critical aspects like;

- Systems
- Weather
- Attitude
- Fuel
- Flight Rules (airspace, minimums, clearances)
- Navigation
- Communication

It is taking in all of the above factors (and more) to asses risk which gives or takes away control from the pilot to ensure safety.

# Concerns

_Machines don't make machines safer, look at the 737 Max_  Flawed redundancy which actually doubles the failure modes are fatal.  IE, multi-engines that can't climb on one engine.  Any redundant system must be tested for partial and total failure modes.  No partial failure mode should cause additional failures or total loss of any one system.

_The more you take the pilot out of the loop, flying won't be fun_  If you have plenty of altitude in good weather, the flight control system will allow most abrupt maneuvers inside the safe flight envelope.  But as you get lower, slower or into weather... you'll find progressively less and less control and more and more feedback as you deviate from the flight plan.

_What if the flight control system goes hay-wire and starts flying nuts?_  The flight control system will be the most redundant system with designed-in failure recovery and it will be very heavily tested.  The likelihood of this happening should be low, but it can and will happen.  The pilot still have direct physical control, you can still land the aircraft.  

_If everything is electric, what if that fails too?_  The electric system is designed for failure as well, but everything can fail. THe electric motor controller will have it's own independent and backed-up power supply from the high voltage and should continue to operate the  electric motor.  If that should also be faulty, the airplane can still glide to a forced landing.
