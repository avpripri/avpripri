# The problem

Flying small aircraft and UAVs on legacy technology is too dangerous.  Technologies do exist now which can assist the pilot, but better approaches could do so much more.

# Essential Goals

1. Use the right technology and software to dramatically enhance small aircraft/UAV flight safety
1. Highly available/reliable, foundation-to-shingles fault tolerant
1. Explore integrate "smarts-system" approaches which enforce safety boundries as well as ease the pilot workload.
1. Build a product homebuilders and UAV manfacturers can purchase and easily integrate into their airframe build

# Non-Essential Goals

1. Integrate flight training into the flight system
1. Remotely monitor/instruct/control an airplane from a ground station.  Ie; instructor mode
1. Cheaper; Fewer accidednts and integrated training means for a typical rental use, this system should be cheaper to own/operate than legacy aircraft systems. 
1. Certification and general availability to all light aircraft and UAV manufacturing

# Non-Goals

1. Airframe agnostic- Not building a new "safer airplane"... Building a safer flight system for any airplane.
1. 
1. Not developing a system for large transport aircraft.  Just too far out of scope and they are well represented.
